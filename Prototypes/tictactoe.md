# Tic Tac Toe

+ **Development Time:** 20 Days
+ **Development Platform:** Phaser.js

### Initial Goals
+ ***Phaser JS*** - I wanted to pick a simple game to create to introduce myself into the Phaser JS landscape and escape tutorial hell.
+ ***Data*** - From previous experience with Phaser, I know I need a reliable and quick method of dealing with game data.
+ ***Illustrator*** - I now have access to Illustrator and AfterEffects. I want to learn and utilize these programs to make assets for future games.
+ ***Modules*** - I want to start building modules for common functionality that can be portable and scalable.

### Successes
+ ***Data Module*** - I built a data module that handles very basic saving/loading functions that effectively use the Local Storage API. It will be easy to implement a database integration into it.
+ ***Tweening*** - Tweening is one of my favorite methods to make things pop! The tweening functionality in Phaser is easy to use and makes for exciting content.

### Failures
+ ***Scenes*** - The creation of screens was no problem, but the transition from scene to scene, and the back and forth got messy. There is still one instance of an Instantiation method being called twice :/.
+ ***Forms*** - I used HTML5 forms for the in-game forms and they turned out simplistic and ugly. I need to look at examples of how other Phaser developers have set up input. My buttons were simplistic, but functioned more like how I'd do future input.

### Lessons Learned
+ ***Phaser Experience*** - In only this simple game, I've already learned so much about the engine and the inner-workings. I'm excited to learn more!
+ ***Documentation*** - Development in this web based engine will not be like working in Unity or Unreal. There is documentation, but not nearly to the degree that there is with others. This will be more of an unknown adventure than anything I've ever worked in before.

+ ***Final Thought*** - I'm excited with how this project turned out. It was my first real deep dive into Phaser and I see it's potential. Of course, I have to understand now the limitations of making 2D browser based games, but the quality of a game doesn't necessarily depend on the quality of the platform. I think I can make this area mine and own it.
