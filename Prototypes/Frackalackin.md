+ **Development Time:** 6 Days
+ **Development Platform:** Unity
+ **Inspiration:** [Kurzgesagt - Fracking explained: opportunity or danger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA)

### Initial Goals
+ ***Flat UI Style*** - I wanted to use Inkscape
+ ***Use Tweening*** - I wanted to use Inkscape
+ ***Algorithmic Terrain Generation*** - I wanted to use Inkscape

### Successes
+ ***Easing Method*** - I had moderate success with the DOTween engine. Learning started slow, however, I started to grasp some of the intricate functions that the engine uses and when they are useful. This will definitely be a solid tool to use in the future and I'm already thinking of ways to use it next.

### Failures
+ ***Art Scope*** - I cut myself a bit of slack for the art in this project because I was learning a new program. This still did not keep me from spending several hours (maybe days) working on art that would either not benefit the project, or be used at all! I realized this time would have been best spent elsewhere.

### Lessons Learned
+ ***Easing Works*** - Easing done right can feel incredibly good. It can give that sense of feedback and motion that are natural and intuitive for players. I am feeling more comfortable implementing tweening methods into games and tweaking until things feel just right.

+ ***Final Thought*** -
