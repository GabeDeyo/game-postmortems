+ **Development Time:** 6 Days
+ **Development Platform:** Unity
+ **Inspiration:** [Kurzgesagt - Fracking explained: opportunity or danger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA)

### Initial Goals
+ ***Flat UI Style*** - Due to the inspiration of the prototype, I wanted to emulate the same style that the creators at Kurzgesagt use. Based on their creation methods and tools, I've decided to again use the open-source software Inkscape.
+ ***Use Tweening*** - My last project Heliosphere was quite successful when tweening was implemented to "spice" up the gameplay. I would like to practice with and explore the tweening engine DOTween.
+ ***Algorithmic Terrain Generation*** - I want to create an algorithm that would randomly create the terrain based on the economy of the location. The drilling location would have a certain amount of resources and a threshold for pollution that would result in the drillers being evicted if crossed. Each location would have a unique economy that would determine the drilling gameplay.

### Successes
+ ***Cohesive Art Style*** - The art process was uniquely quick and easy for this project. Much of it was inspired from the video, and the end result looks much better than most project I've worked on.

### Failures
+ ***Drill Controller*** - The base foundation for creating the drill came together incredibly quickly, but I never got past that. Once I moved on to the terrain and economy side of things, the main gameplay was simply neglected. The final state of the drill was no more than functional. The drill gameplay would need to be the key gameplay ingredient if this project was to continue.
+ ***Economy vs. Gameplay*** - 

### Lessons Learned
+ ***Easing Works*** - Easing done right can feel incredibly good. It can give that sense of feedback and motion that are natural and intuitive for players. I am feeling more comfortable implementing tweening methods into games and tweaking until things feel just right.
