# Lights Out

+ **Development Time:** 7 Days
+ **Development Platform:** Unity

### Initial Goals
+ ***Design Patterns*** - I wanted to identify common development patterns that were effective for me. 
+ ***3D Modeling*** - I wanted to try my hand at some 3D modeling in Blender. I think the lightbulb turned out awesome, the rest... not so much.
+ ***Initial Skill Gauge*** - I wanted to discover where my development skills were after school.

### Successes
+ ***Lightbulb*** - Almost every aspect of the lightbulb turned out how I wanted. This includes the model, the lightbulb code and the light emission.
+ ***System Architecture*** - There were few in-game systems that had to communicate with each other. I was happy with how they worked together. I tried to follow basic S.O.L.I.D principles.
+ ***Skill Gauge*** - The review process for this game shed lots of light on what I was good at and what I wasn't. If anything, this project made me realize how much time I need to dedicate to these projects.

### Failures
+ ***Modeling Time*** - I spent far too much time (2 days) modeling the in-game items. Most of this was tutorial garbage, neverthless, this took away from design time which severly hampered this games overall engagement.
+ ***World Canvas*** - When it came to dynamic UI working in the game, I made many mistakes here. I learned a lot about how text and images should be represented in the world space.
+ ***Feedback*** - Even when systems were able to communicate with each other, there was hardly any feedback at all that anything was happening. The game is nearly impossible to play because of zero input feedback.

### Lessons Learned
+ ***Artistry*** - When put on a deadline, I should not sink all my time into art. The end result is lots of wasted time that could have been spent making the game function in the first place. (I'm not very good either)
+ ***Instinctive Gameplay*** - Even when starting up my own game, there were times when I was a little confused about what to do. This highlighted how important it is to have subtle cues to guide the player as to what they should be doing.
+ ***Lifecycle*** - By the time I got to the end, I realized I had almost no success or fail state. Honestly, there is hardly even a middle or beginning either.
+ ***Final Thought*** - In my case: ***Design > Art***
